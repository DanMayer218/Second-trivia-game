This is the Node your Code trivia game.  It features a timer that you must beat when choosing your answers.  Its uses external css and javascript files for the style and dynamic elements of the game.  

The game operates using functions to begin, clicks to recieve the users choices, actions for if the timer runs out, iterate to the next question, check the answers and display the results in the end.

Hope you enjoy it,

Thank you,
